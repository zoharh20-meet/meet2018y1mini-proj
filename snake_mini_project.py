##2. Make functions down(), left(), and right() that change direction
#####WRITE YOUR CODE HERE!!
#
#turtle.onkeypress(up, UP_ARROW) # Create listener for up key

##3. Do the same for the other arrow keys

##Go to the top of your file, and after the line that says direction = UP,  write:
#
#UP_EDGE = 250
#DOWN_EDGE = -250
#RIGHT_EDGE = 400
#LEFT_EDGE = -400
#
#
##Now go add code to the end of your  move_snake() function
#
#def move_snake():
#
#    . . .
#
#    #Add new lines to the end of the function
#    #Grab position of snake
#    new_pos = snake.pos()
#    new_x_pos = new_pos[0]
#    new_y_pos = new_pos[1]
#
## The next three lines check if the snake is hitting the 
## right edge.
#if new_x_pos >= RIGHT_EDGE:
#print(“You hit the right edge! Game over!”)
#quit()
#
#     # You should write code to check for the left, top, and bottom edges.
